# Airbnb-Dynamic-Pricing-Recommendation-Engine
Using data from Airbnb, this project suggests the best listing pricing according to location, time of year, kind of home, and reviews. To assist hosts in making data-driven pricing decisions, it incorporates an interactive dashboard, a price prediction model, and a summary report using Python, Excel, and Tableau.
